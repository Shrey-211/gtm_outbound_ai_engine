Hi Maria,

I noticed Maria’s Hospitality uses Escapia to manage your mixed portfolio across Africa. I’m reaching out because PriceLabs integrates directly with Escapia to automate dynamic pricing and stay restrictions—helping you increase revenue and save hours on rate updates.

Would you be open to a quick demo to see how PriceLabs can optimize your listings and streamline your workflow?
